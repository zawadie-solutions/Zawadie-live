# Google Review Monitor

A daily job (07:00 CAT) that reads Google review links from Asana, checks whether each review still exists, and **notifies Vanessa once** when a review has disappeared — as a Slack DM if `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is set, otherwise by email. A small read-only dashboard (white/green/red, Basic auth, needs `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`) is a monitoring panel, not a review-management tool: three counts (monitored / still available / removed), the last and next check times, which reviews are currently flagged as removed (with a link to the Asana task), and a short daily activity feed. `npm start` runs scheduler + dashboard, `npm run dashboard` runs the dashboard alone, `npm run preview` shows it with fake data on http://localhost:3100 (demo / demo).

```
Asana -> Google URL -> checkReview() -> EXISTS: silent | UNKNOWN: log, retry tomorrow | REMOVED: notify once (Slack DM or email)
```

## Setup
1. `npm install`, create a PostgreSQL database, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in (never commit `.env`). URL-encode special characters in the DB password (`#` -> `%23`) and quote the value.
2. `npm run migrate` creates the tables.
3. `npm run discover` prints the Asana project tree and what it extracts. Adjust `ASANA_MONTH_INDEX` / `ASANA_LOCATION_INDEX` / `ASANA_MAX_DEPTH` until month and location are right. Any task whose description holds a Google Maps/review link is a review task; `Reviewer: Name` and `Rating: N` lines in the description are used when present.
4. Copy `config/locations.example.json` to `config/locations.json` (Asana location name -> Business Profile `accounts/…/locations/…`).
5. `npm run poc -- --url <url> --location "Location A" --reviewer "John Smith"` on one live and one removed review before trusting it.
6. `npm run run-once` does one full cycle (exit code 1 if any stage failed). `npm start` keeps a process running that does it daily at 07:00 `Africa/Maputo` (CAT, UTC+2, no DST). Alternatively schedule `npm run run-once` with Windows Task Scheduler.

## Months
Each month is a separate Asana project (separate `ASANA_PROJECT_GID`). The daily 07:00 job only ever syncs/checks/notifies for the one project currently in `.env` — the current month, by design, so the automated job's workload doesn't grow every time a new month starts.

To look back at an older month on demand (e.g. "did that review from two months ago ever get removed?"), run `npm run check-month -- --project <that month's Asana project gid> [--notify]`. It syncs and checks just that project, then marks every review it touched as no longer part of the daily cycle — so a look-back never bloats the automated job. Results land in the DB and show up in the dashboard's month picker (only shown once more than one month has been synced); pass `--notify` to actually send a Slack DM/email for anything it finds removed, which is off by default since a stale dispute resurfacing shouldn't page Vanessa the way a fresh one should.

## Rules that prevent false alerts
- `REVIEW_REMOVED` only if Google's review listing for the location is complete **and** the reviewer is absent **and** a second check a minute later agrees. Anything else (HTTP error, rate limit, auth, timeout, incomplete listing, bad URL, unmapped location, missing reviewer name) is `UNKNOWN`: logged, no email, retried next run.
- One digest notification for newly removed reviews only. `notification_sent` is set only after the send succeeds; a failed send is retried next run. A review is notified once, then no longer checked (`KEEP_CHECKING_REMOVED=true` to keep checking; a reappearing review resets its state).
- The Asana sync reads everything before writing, so an Asana failure leaves existing records untouched.

## Limits
Uses the Google Business Profile API, which only works for locations the authorised Google account manages, and matches by reviewer display name (Asana has no review ID). A renamed reviewer could look removed. Not yet verified against live Google/Asana — only mocked tests (`npm test`). Pilot against manual checks first. Run a single instance. If an email is sent but the DB write then fails, a duplicate is possible.

Set `REVIEW_CHECKER=places` and `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` to check with the Places API (New) instead: no access to the business profile needed, the place is found from the Asana location name and confirmed against the CID in the review link, and the review is matched by its ID or reviewer name. Places returns at most 5 reviews per place, so a review it does not return is `UNKNOWN` unless the place has no more reviews than were returned.

## Layout
`src/asana` sync · `src/google` checker (swap behind `ReviewChecker`) · `src/notify` Slack DM / email (swap behind `Notifier`) · `src/monitor/cycle.ts` the daily job · `src/db` schema + repo · `src/index.ts` scheduler
